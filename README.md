MyReads is a project submission for the first project submission for the ReactJS Nanodegree program in Udacity. The idea is to create an application that allows you to categorize books into shelves such as *Currently Reading*, *Want to Read* and *Read*. Additionally, the application should be able to GET/POST data from an external server. The application also has a search feature with limited terms look at the file *SEARCH_TERMS.md*; the result-set comes directly from the external server.

## Quick Install

Just install all project dependencies with `npm install` and you will be ready to go.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the *react-router-dom*, which uses the npm package manager and will be automatically installed by following the setup instructions above.

## Usage

The application has two screens the main screen and the search screen. The initial screen comes pre-loaded with a set of books that you can swap around, and you can also search for new books by using the search function.

## Limitations

The project functionality is limited but works as intended.

## Credits
